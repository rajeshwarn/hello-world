# iPhoneList #

If you don't have a "phonedmg" folder, you can get the iTunesMobileDevice.dll that's required in your C:\Program Files\Common Files\Apple\Mobile Device Support\bin folder. Make sure it's in the same folder as iPhoneList.

It's based on a modified superset of manzana, an iPhone class library created by Peter Dennis Bartok.
