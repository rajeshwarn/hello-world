# Introduction #

I want a fully functional GUI into the iPhone file system. This program is based on Manzana, Peter Dennis Bartok's C# class-library implementation of some of the work done by the #iphone-dev jailbreak and iphoneinterface teams.


## In Progress ##
Binary PList conversion is almost complete. Keep checking.
After that I go after the PNG conversion. All windows C# code (for now)

I'm considering moving the project to MONO or Lazarus / FreePascal for multi-OS operation...

Thoughts??
